**Conjuration cantrip**

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
**Range:** 20 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a small twig)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute.

Choose one creature you can see within range. That creature must
succeed on a Dexterity Saving throw or become connected to you with
a magical vine. A creature that you are connected with must make a
Strength saving throw whenever they attempt to move to a point more
than 20 feet away from you. On a failed save, their speed is reduced to
zero until the start of their next turn and they are knocked prone. On a
successful save, the vine snaps, and they are freed.
